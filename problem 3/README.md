# Problem: Log file Analyzer

Load and parse the given program log file to generate insights on the frequency of warnings, errors and most common error types.

## Statement

You are given a LOG file `sample.log` that was generated by a different Program. It is in a standard format (all lines follow the same formatting) and also each line indicates the severity level of the log (e.g. `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`).

Sample log lines:

```
2024-01-01 00:00:00 ERROR
```

Write a Python program / functions to:

1. Load the log data, parse it properly.
    * If any line is malformed, skip it but display something in output about it, don't silently ignore it.

2. Count how many `ERROR`, `INFO`, `DEBUG`, etc. entries there are.

3. List all timestamps of `ERROR` messages

4. Print the most frequent log level.

5. Are there any error messages that repeatedly occur?

6. Average Time Between Logs: Compute the average time delta (in seconds or minutes) between consecutive log entries.

7. Detect Bursts of Errors:
    * Identify if more than N `ERROR` logs occurred within any 5-minute sliding window (e.g., N=3, so 3 consecutive lines of `ERROR`).
    * Print the time ranges of such bursts.
    * Do the same for `WARNING` logs.
